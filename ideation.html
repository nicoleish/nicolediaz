    Using InDesign, I designed wireframes for a Link NYC digital screen interface to display some aspect of time. I choose to express time using a digital hourglass that would flip every hour with its background displaying the colors of the sky every hour, starting at 4 am-4 pm then changing to the appropriate colors from 4 pm-4 am.</div> -->

    As a team of 3, we created a video documenting the creative process of Hayao Miyazaki. This was not a “documentary” in the traditional sense, the video both documents your chosen creator’s process, and is also an experimental video work in and of itself. It's about telling the story of how he came to be an artist. It's about our team telling the story of his process, without a linear narrative.</div>

  Imagine our civilization 20 years from now. Things have either collapsed beyond repair or life has become a harmonious dream. Through some crazy combination of wormholes and string theory, you have the opportunity to create a piece of information that will be sent back to the current population.
